# odin_projects
The Odin Project portfolio

HOW TO USE GIT/GITHUB:
using terminal, enter the directory, "odin_projects"
hopefully I didn't start the new project on GITHUB, I still don't know how to do that.
make your new directory for the project inside "odin_projects" using terminal.
add some files to it. 
When you've made simple changes, return to the directory, "odin_projects"
git add -A
git commit -m "describe changes made"
do this every time you want to describe which changes you made
to update and save on GITHUB, 
git push origin master
